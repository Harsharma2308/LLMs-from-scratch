- **Embedding Dim**: 768
- **Layers**: 12 transformer blocks
- **Attention Heads**: 12

## 🚀 Key Technical Learnings

### 1. GPU Utilization Insights
- **Compute-bound vs Memory-bound**: 100% GPU utilization with only 7GB/12GB VRAM used
- **Lesson**: High GPU utilization ≠ need for larger batches
- **Optimization**: Focus on compute efficiency (fp16) rather than just filling memory

### 2. Training Loss vs Validation Loss
- **Training Loss**: "Free" - computed during required forward pass
- **Validation Loss**: "Expensive" - requires additional forward passes
- **Best Practice**: Log training loss every step, validate every 100-500 steps

### 3. Batch Size Optimization
```python
# Current optimal settings
"batch_size": 8,  # Sweet spot for RTX 3500
"learning_rate": 5e-4,
```
- Larger batches don't always = faster training when compute-bound
- Measure samples/second, not just steps/second
- Small batches often generalize better

### 4. Text Generation Evolution
```
Step 0:    "Theiscons seas|unit Illustrated Supervisor..." (gibberish)
Step 500:  "The 'What only, 'I can he may be human at?'" (learning structure)
Step 1600: "The gardeners of the siphappearance, and would..." (coherent phrases)
```

### 5. Understanding Perplexity - The Model's Uncertainty Metric

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
PPL = exp(-1/N ∑ᵢ log p(yᵢ))
```
Where:
- It's the exponential of the average negative log-likelihood
- Equals the geometric mean of the inverse probability the model assigns to true tokens

**Key Insight: Perplexity = Effective Branching Factor**

If the model predicts uniformly over K tokens:
- p(y) = 1/K (equal probability for each token)
- Loss per token = -log(1/K) = log(K)
- Perplexity = exp(log(K)) = K

**Intuitive Interpretations:**
- **PPL = 10**: Model is as uncertain as choosing among ~10 equally likely tokens
- **PPL = 1**: Perfect prediction (assigns probability 1 to correct token)
- **PPL = vocab_size (~50K)**: Random guessing over entire vocabulary
- **PPL = 100**: At each step, model narrows down to ~100 likely candidates

**Our Training Results:**
- Started at PPL ~60,000 (nearly random)
- Ended at PPL ~29 (training) and ~115 (validation)
- This means our model went from "choosing among 60K options" to "choosing among 29-115 options"

## 💡 Architecture & Implementation Insights

### Gradient Updates
- **Every Step Process**:
  1. Forward pass on batch (8 sequences)
  2. Compute loss (averaged over batch)
  3. Backward pass (gradients for all params)
  4. Optimizer step (weight update)
  5. Log metrics

### Evaluation Strategy
```python
if global_step % 100 == 0:  # Every 100 steps
    # Sample 5 batches for quick evaluation
    train_loss = calc_loss_loader(train_loader, model, device, num_batches=5)
    val_loss = calc_loss_loader(val_loader, model, device, num_batches=5)
```

## 🐛 Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. CUDA Initialization Failure
- **Problem**: Training ran on CPU for 36 hours instead of GPU
- **Root Cause**: PyTorch CUDA initialization error
- **Solution**: 
  - Added strict GPU checking
  - Implemented `--force-cpu` flag that exits after 1 step
  - Clear error messages with options

### 2. Unicode Display Issues
- **Problem**: W&B showing garbled text (""'s)
- **Solution**: Unicode-to-ASCII converter for clean display
```python
replacements = {
    '\u2019': "'",  # Right single quotation mark
    '\u201c': '"',  # Left double quotation mark
    # ... etc
}
```

### 3. Performance Degradation Over Time
- **Observation**: Evaluation time jumped from 1.4s to 12.2s at step 700
- **Possible Causes**: GPU thermal throttling, memory fragmentation
- **Mitigation**: Consider periodic `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

## 📈 Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Mixed Precision Training
```python
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
# Can provide 2x speedup with minimal code changes
```

### 2. Gradient Accumulation
```python
# Simulate larger batches without memory increase
accumulation_steps = 2
loss = loss / accumulation_steps
```

### 3. Learning Rate Scheduling
- Current: Fixed 5e-4
- Better: Cosine decay or warmup + decay

### 4. Early Stopping
- Validation loss plateaued at step 1300
- Could save 20% training time
