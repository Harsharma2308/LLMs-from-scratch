# üìö Guide to Loading Pretrained GPT-2 Weights

## üéØ Overview

After training your own GPT model, you can load pretrained weights from OpenAI's GPT-2 to see how a fully trained model performs. This guide covers multiple methods for loading these weights.

## üîÑ Weight Loading Methods

### 1. TensorFlow Checkpoint Method (Original)
- **Source**: OpenAI's original TensorFlow checkpoints
- **Pros**: Direct from source
- **Cons**: Requires TensorFlow, complex weight mapping
- **Process**:
  1. Download TF checkpoint files from OpenAI
  2. Load using TensorFlow
  3. Convert weight format (transpose, split QKV, etc.)
  4. Map to PyTorch model structure

### 2. PyTorch State Dict Method (Recommended) ‚úÖ
- **Source**: Pre-converted weights on HuggingFace
- **URL**: `https://huggingface.co/rasbt/gpt2-from-scratch-pytorch`
- **Pros**: Simple, fast, no TensorFlow needed
- **Cons**: Depends on pre-converted weights
- **Process**:
  ```python
  # Download weights
  url = "https://huggingface.co/rasbt/gpt2-from-scratch-pytorch/resolve/main/gpt2-small-124M.pth"
  
  # Load directly
  state_dict = torch.load("gpt2-small-124M.pth", weights_only=True)
  model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
  ```

### 3. HuggingFace Transformers Method
- **Source**: HuggingFace Model Hub
- **Pros**: Always up-to-date, handles downloading
- **Cons**: Requires transformers library, manual weight mapping
- **Process**:
  ```python
  from transformers import GPT2Model
  hf_model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained("gpt2")
  # Then manually map weights to your model
  ```

### 4. SafeTensors Method
- **Source**: HuggingFace (safer format)
- **Pros**: Secure, memory efficient
- **Cons**: Requires safetensors library
- **Process**: Similar to state dict but uses `.safetensors` files

## üîß Key Weight Transformations

When converting from OpenAI's format to our PyTorch model:

1. **Attention Weights**: 
   - OpenAI: Combined QKV in single matrix `c_attn`
   - Ours: Separate `W_query`, `W_key`, `W_value`
   - Action: Split the combined matrix into three parts

2. **Weight Transposition**:
   - TensorFlow uses different dimension ordering than PyTorch
   - Most weights need `.T` (transpose) when converting

3. **Parameter Names**:
   - Layer norm: `g`/`b` ‚Üí `scale`/`shift`
   - Embeddings: `wte`/`wpe` ‚Üí `tok_emb`/`pos_emb`
   - Blocks: `h.{i}` ‚Üí `trf_blocks[{i}]`

4. **Shared Weights**:
   - Output projection shares weights with token embeddings

## üìä Model Comparison

### Your Trained Model (777K tokens, 1000 steps):
```
Prompt: "The meaning of life is"
Output: "The meaning of life is other." "I cannot think you know one which this "Yes," said this."
```

### OpenAI Pretrained Model (40GB text, millions of steps):
```
Prompt: "The meaning of life is"
Output: "The meaning of life is not always always the same; the best life is just the best life..."
```

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Scale Matters**: OpenAI trained on ~40GB of text vs our 777K tokens
2. **Coherence**: Pretrained models generate grammatically correct, coherent text
3. **Bias in Attention**: OpenAI uses bias vectors in attention (we typically don't)
4. **Context Length**: OpenAI's GPT-2 supports 1024 tokens vs our 256

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Using the recommended PyTorch method
python gpt_pretraining_pipeline/scripts/load_pytorch_weights.py
```

This will:
1. Download 703MB of pre-converted weights
2. Load them into our GPTModel architecture
3. Generate sample text to verify it works

## üìà Performance Comparison

| Metric | Your Model | OpenAI GPT-2 |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Training Data | 777K tokens | ~40GB text |
| Training Time | 79 minutes | Weeks/months |
| Final Loss | 4.12 | ~2.5 |
| Perplexity | 61.4 | ~20-30 |
| Coherence | Poor | Excellent |

## üéì Learning Value

While your model shows the training process works, the pretrained weights demonstrate:
- The importance of scale in language modeling
- How coherent text generation emerges from large-scale training
- The value of pretrained models for practical applications
- Why fine-tuning pretrained models is often preferred over training from scratch

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Fine-tuning**: Take the pretrained model and fine-tune on your specific data
2. **Larger Models**: Try loading GPT-2 Medium (355M), Large (774M), or XL (1.5B)
3. **Modern Models**: Explore loading Llama, GPT-J, or other open models
4. **Optimization**: Implement techniques like quantization or pruning
